In this paper, we developed an efficient algorithm to solve the TV constrained FWI problem with neither an inner loop nor approximations based on PDS.
We demonstrated the constrained problem can be fully handled within the PDS algorithm.
We also demonstrated the piecewise smoothness by the TV constraint is well represented even when the PDS algorithm is used, and that efficient and accurate reconstruction is possible.
Furthermore, the PDS framework allows for the incorporation of more complex constraints and regularizations, making it a valuable tool for future research.
