In this paper, we developed an efficient algorithm to solve the TV and box constrained FWI problem with neither inner loops nor approximations based on PDS.
We demonstrated that the constrained problem can be fully handled within PDS.
We also demonstrated that the piecewise smoothness by the TV constraint is well represented even when PDS is used, and that efficient and accurate reconstruction is possible.
Furthermore, framework of PDS allows for the incorporation of more complex constraints and regularizations, making it a valuable tool for future research.
