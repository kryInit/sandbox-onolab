In this paper, we developed an efficient algorithm to solve the TV and box constrained FWI problem based on PDS.
Our algorithm handles the constraints completely without approximations, leading to more accurate reconstructions.
Furthermore, by handling the constraints without inner loops, the algorithm significantly enhances computational efficiency.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method successfully eliminates wave-like artifacts and noise present in the standard FWI method, resulting in a more accurate velocity model and a higher SSIM value.
