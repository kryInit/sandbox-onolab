\begin{summary}
Full waveform inversion (FWI) aims to reconstruct subsurface properties from observed seismic data.
Since FWI is an ill-posed inverse problem, appropriate regularizations or constraints are effective approaches to achieve accurate reconstruction.
The total variation (TV) -type regularization or constraint is widely known as a powerful prior that models the piecewise smoothness of subsurface properties.
However, the optimization problem of the TV-type regularized or constrained FWI is difficult to solve due to the nonlinearity of the observation process and the non-smoothness of the TV-type regularization or constraint.
Conventional approaches to solve the FWI problem rely on an inner loop and/or approximations, resulting in high computational cost and/or inappropriate solutions.
In this paper, we develop an efficient algorithm with neither an inner loop nor approximations to solve the FWI problem based on a primal-dual splitting method.
We also demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method through experiments using the SEG/EAGE Salt and Overthrust Models.
