As shown in fig.\ref{fig:salt-model}, velocity model of salt model is piecewise smooth.
Therefore, we introduce TV constraints to achieve more accurate reconstruction.
Also, by introducing a box constraint, we can ensure that the velocity model does not take invalid values, and we show the flexibility of incorporating constraints when using PDS.

We minimize the objective function of the TV and box constrained FWI, which is expressed by the following:
\begin{equation} \label{eq:FWIObjectiveWithTVConstraint} \argmin{\velModel \in \realNumber^N} \ \ \FWIObjectiveWithTVConstraint \end{equation}
where $\alpha \in \realNumber$ is the upper bound of the $l_{1,2}$ norm, and $a, b \in \realNumber$ are the lower and upper bound of the velocity model value, respectively.

The constraints can be integrated into the objective function as indicator functions:
\begin{equation} \label{eq:FWIObjectiveWithTVConstraintWithIndicatorFunction} \argmin{\velModel \in \realNumber^N} \ \ \FWIObjectiveWithTVConstraintWithIndicatorFunction \end{equation}

As mentioned in section~\ref{subsec:mathematical-tools}, $\iota_{\LOneTwoNorm{\cdot} \le \alpha}$ and $\iota_{[a,b]^N}$ can be computed efficiently\eqref{eq:ProximityOperatorForL1Ball}\eqref{eq:ProximityOperatorForL12Ball}.
Therefore, these functions of $E$, $\iota_{[a,b]^N}$ and $\iota_{\LOneTwoNorm{\cdot} \le \alpha}$ correspond to $f$, $g$ and $h$ in \eqref{eq:PDSPrimalEq}, respectively, $\diffOperator$ is corresponds to $\bm{L}$, and the problem~\eqref{eq:FWIObjectiveWithTVConstraintWithIndicatorFunction} can be solved using PDS.
The iterative procedures are as follows:
\begin{equation} \label{eq:FWIWithPDS} \FWIWithPDS \notag \end{equation}
