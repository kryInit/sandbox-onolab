I would like to express my sincere gratitude to Associate Professor Shunsuke Ono for his great support and careful and detailed guidance from the stage of basic study to the present research.
In writing this paper, I would also like to thank him for his valuable advice and help on my poor writing, in spite of his busy schedule.
I have also received much support from my classmates and seniors in the same laboratory.
In particular, I am grateful to Mr. Shingo Takemoto, a senior student in the same laboratory, for his advice on the direction of my research, how to proceed, and how to write papers, as well as for his support in my daily research activities.
I would like to take this opportunity to express my deepest gratitude to all of them.
