In this paper, we developed an efficient algorithm to solve the TV and box constrained FWI problem based on PDS.
Our algorithm does not require approximations when incorporating the constraints, leading to more accurate reconstructions.
Furthermore, the algorithm significantly enhances computational efficiency without inner loops.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method successfully eliminates wave-like artifacts and noise present in the standard FWI method, resulting in a more accurate velocity model and a superior RMSE and SSIM value regardless of the presence of noise in the observed seismic data.
