This paper proposes a computationally efficient algorithm to address the Full-Waveform Inversion (FWI) problem with a Total Variation (TV) constraint, designed to accurately reconstruct subsurface properties from seismic data.
FWI, as an ill-posed inverse problem, requires effective regularizations or constraints to ensure accurate and stable solutions.
Among these, the TV constraint is widely known as a powerful prior for modeling the piecewise smooth structure of subsurface properties.
However, solving the optimization problem is challenging because of the nonlinear observation process combined with the non-smoothness of the TV constraint.
Conventional methods rely on inner loops and/or approximations, which lead to high computational cost and/or inappropriate solutions.
We develop an algorithm based on a primal-dual splitting method to achieve both efficiency and accuracy without inner loops or approximations.
We also demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method through experiments using the SEG/EAGE Salt and Overthrust Models.
