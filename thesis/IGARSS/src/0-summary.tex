This paper proposes a computationally efficient algorithm for addressing the Full Waveform Inversion (FWI) problem with a Total Variation (TV) constraint, designed to reconstruct subsurface properties from seismic data.
FWI, as an ill-posed inverse problem, requires effective regularizations or constraints to ensure accurate and stable solutions.
Among these, the TV constraint is widely known as a powerful prior for modeling the piecewise smooth structure of subsurface properties.
However, solving the optimization problem is challenging due to the combination of the nonlinearity of the observation process and the non-smoothness of the TV constraint.
Conventional methods rely on inner loops and/or approximations, which lead to high computational cost and/or inappropriate solutions.
We develop an efficient algorithm with neither inner loops nor approximations to solve the FWI problem based on a primal-dual splitting method.
We also demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method through experiments using the SEG/EAGE Salt and Overthrust Models.
