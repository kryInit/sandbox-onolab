``Efficient and Accurate Full-Waveform Inversion with Total Variation Constraint''
by Yudai Inada, Shingo Takemoto, and Shunsuke Ono to be considered for publication in
the IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters.
Please find attached the main manuscript in PDF format.

% This article proposes a cartoon-texture image decomposition framework
% using a novel convex prior for texture characterization.

%This article proposes a new destriping framework using a novel mathematical model for imaging data in remote sensing.

%This article proposes a new denoising method based on graph signal processing for hyperspectral images.
This article proposes an efficient and accurate Full-Waveform Inversion (FWI) algorithm with a Total Variation (TV) constraint for seismic data.
We believe our work will be of interest to the readers of your journal.



We declare that this manuscript is original, has not been published before
and is not currently being considered for publication.
%except in preliminary forms such as part of conference proceedings entitled
%``Zero-gradient constraints for destriping of remote-sensing data'' (reference [35] in the manuscript).
% and a technical report entitled
% ``A blockwise low-rank prior for cartoon-texture image decomposition'' (reference [31] in the manuscript).
%The manuscript has been read and approved by all named authors.

We hope you find our manuscript suitable for publication and look forward to hearing from you.
Thank you in advance for your kind handling.
\closing{Sincerely yours,}
