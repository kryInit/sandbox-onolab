    "We conclude our introduction to the Acoustic Problem, including simulations in the Devito environment, highlighting the following items:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The simulation time when using Devito is small, when compared to routines that use pure Python;\n",
    "- Devito has a simplified language for building operators and equations, once the user acquires familiarity with the package;\n",
    "- When no reflection reduction strategy is used, at the end of the simulation we observe a large amount of noise in our image;\n",
    "- The constructions employed here can be used as a basis for implementing the methods with absorbing boundary conditions or absorbing boundary layers;"
