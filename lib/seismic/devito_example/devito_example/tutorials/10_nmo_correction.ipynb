    "In reflection seismology, normal moveout (NMO) describes the effect that the distance between a seismic source and a receiver (the offset) has on the arrival time of a reflection in the form of an increase of time with offset.

    "Consider a reflection event on a CMP gather. The difference between the two-way time at a given offset and the two-way zero-offset time is called normal moveout (NMO). Reflection traveltimes must be corrected for NMO prior to summing the traces in the CMP gather along the offset axis. The normal moveout depends on velocity above the reflector, offset, two-way zero-offset time associated with the reflection event, dip of the reflector, the source-receiver azimuth with respect to the true-dip direction, and the degree of complexity of the near-surface and the medium above the reflector.\n",
