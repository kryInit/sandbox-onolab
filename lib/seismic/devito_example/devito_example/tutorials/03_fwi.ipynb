    "# 03 - Full-Waveform Inversion (FWI)\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is the third in a series of tutorial highlighting various aspects of seismic inversion based on Devito operators. In this second example we aim to highlight the core ideas behind seismic inversion, where we create an image of the subsurface from field recorded data. This tutorial follows on the modelling tutorial and will reuse the modelling and velocity model.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Inversion requirement\n",
    "\n",
    "Seismic inversion relies on two known parameters:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Field data** - or also called **recorded data**. This is a shot record corresponding to the true velocity model. In practice this data is acquired as described in the first tutorial. In order to simplify this tutorial we will fake field data by modelling it with the true velocity model.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Initial velocity model**. This is a velocity model that has been obtained by processing the field data. This model is a rough and very smooth estimate of the velocity as an initial estimate for the inversion. This is a necessary requirement for any optimization (method).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Inversion computational setup\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we will introduce the gradient operator. This operator corresponds to the imaging condition introduced in the previous tutorial with some minor modifications that are defined by the objective function (also referred to in the tutorial series as the *functional*, *f*) and its gradient, *g*. We will define these two terms in the tutorial too.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Notes on the operators\n",
    "\n",
    "As we have already described the creation of a forward modelling operator, we will only call a wrapper function here. This wrapper already contains all the necessary operators for seismic modeling, imaging and inversion. Operators introduced for the first time in this tutorial will be properly described."
