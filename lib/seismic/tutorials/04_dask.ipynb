Furthermore, we will show how our parallel FWI function can be passed to black-box third party optimization libraries, such as SciPy's [optimize](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/tutorial/optimize.html) package, to access sophisticated optimization algorithms without having to implement them from scratch!\n",

As computing multiple seismic shot records or gradients for subsequent source locations is an embarassingly parallel process, we will use Dask to dynamically distribute our workload to a pool of available workers and afterwards collect the results.\n",

Subsequently, we will implement serial versions of forward modeling and FWI objective functions and then show how we can use Dask to implement parallel versions of these functions. Finally, we will show how to write a wrapper that lets us pass our objective function to scipy's optimize package and how to run a small 2D FWI example using a limited-memory Quasi-Newton method."

    "In our current example, the master process keeps all shot records in memory and distributes the data to the workers in the parallel pool. This works perfectly fine for 2D and even small 3D examples, but quickly becomes infeasible for large-scale data sets. Therefore, an extension of our current code should include the following steps if we want to scale things up in the future:\n",

    "For scaling Devito to industry-scale problems and being able to work on data sets in the range of multiple terabytes, it is furthermore necessary to have a fast SEG-Y reader that is able to scan through large data volumes and efficiently access blocks of data such as single shot records. Furthermore, we need the SEG-Y reader to be able to interact with Devito and automatically set up `geometry` objects from the SEG-Y headers. For this purpose, please check out the [Julia Devito Inversion framework (JUDI)](https://github.com/slimgroup/JUDI.jl), an extension built on top of Devito in the Julia programming language. JUDI consists on an abstract linear algebra framework and an interface to a fast and parallel SEG-Y reader called [SEGYIO.jl](https://github.com/slimgroup/SegyIO.jl), making it possible to:\n",

    " - Scan large-scale data sets and create look-up tables from which shot records can be directly accessed through their byte locations (no need to loop over traces or read full files).\n",
    " \n",
    " - Use look-up tables to automatically set up Devito objects with source and receiver coordinates. \n",
    " \n",
    " - Work with out-of-core data containers that only read the data into memory when it is used for computations.\n",
