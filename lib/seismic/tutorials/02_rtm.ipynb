In this second example we aim to highlight the core ideas behind seismic inversion, where we create an image of the subsurface from field recorded data. This tutorial follows on the modelling tutorial and will reuse the modelling operator and velocity model.\n",

In order to simplify this tutorial we will generate synthetic field data by modelling it with the **true velocity model**.\n",

This time reversal led to the naming of the method we present here, called Reverse Time Migration. The notion of adjoint in exploration geophysics is fundamental as most of the wave-equation based imaging and inversion methods rely on adjoint based optimization methods.\n",

The `AcousticWaveSolver` provides a more concise API for common wave propagation operators and caches the Devito `Operator` objects to avoid unnecessary recompilation. Operators introduced for the first time in this tutorial will be properly described.\n",
